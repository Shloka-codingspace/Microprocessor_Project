# Text Encryption and Decryption using 8086 Microprocessor

This project demonstrates how to **encrypt and decrypt a string** using assembly language on the **Intel 8086 microprocessor**. It is a basic simulation of text cryptography implemented using TASM or MASM.

The project implements:

- Character-by-character encryption** using a Caesar cipher-like technique (shift-based).
- Decryption routine** that reverses the process to retrieve the original text.
- Designed to run on 8086 emulators like  DOSBox, or Turbo Assembler.


##  Features
- User inputs plaintext (e.g., "HELLO").
- Each character is shifted by a fixed key (e.g., +3) to produce ciphertext.
- Decryption uses the inverse shift (-3) to recover the original message.
- Works on emulated 8086 environment.

## Tools Required
- TASM / MASM
- DOSBox (if using TASM on Windows 10/11)
- Windows / DOS environment
